These layers can be used to show a summary or the data on the next page or simply have the next page inside the layer.\r\n\r\n#To add a new layer:\r\n\r\n##Step 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar handler = LayerHandler() //Will default to fullscreen\r\nhandler.frame = frame\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nvar handler = LayerHandler(frame: frame)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Step 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhandler.addLayer(color, title: \"title\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Step 3:\r\n\r\nWhile adding layer you can add InnerViews\r\n```\r\nhandler.addLayer(blue, title: \"First\").addToInnerView({\r\n            let label = UILabel(frame: CGRectMake(20, 40, 100, 40))\r\n            label.text = \"Inside the First view!\"\r\n            label.sizeToFit()\r\n            return label\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nYou can search for the layer by the title\r\n```\r\nhandler.layerWithTitle(\"Second\")?.addToInnerView({\r\n            let buttonSegue = UIButton(frame: CGRectMake(30, 50, screenWidth-60, 50))\r\n            buttonSegue.setTitle(\"Next\", forState: UIControlState.Normal)\r\n            buttonSegue.addTarget(self, action: \"segue:\", forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\r\n            buttonSegue.titleLabel?.textAlignment = .Center\r\n            buttonSegue.titleLabel?.textColor = .blackColor()\r\n            return buttonSegue\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n##Step 4:\r\n\r\n```\r\nview.addSubview(handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#License\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015, Zach Eriksen All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
